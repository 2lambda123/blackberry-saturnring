1. Copy SSH key to the new iSCSI server
cd /nfsmount/saturnring/saturnconfig
ssh-copy-id -i saturnkey local@<new_iscsi_ip>

2. As admin user, add the server via the portal (new storagehost)

3. If the VG (usually called "storevg")  is already created on the new server a new VG should be populated in the portal within ~2 minutes
